        "A": "ICDs are indicated in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and reduced ejection fraction (typically <35%) to prevent sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias. ICDs monitor the heart鈥檚 rhythm and deliver shocks or pacing to terminate life-threatening arrhythmias, significantly improving survival in high-risk patients."
    },
    {
        "Q": "How does digoxin function in the management of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, and what are the risks of toxicity?",
        "A": "Digoxin increases the force of myocardial contraction (positive inotropy) and slows atrioventricular conduction, making it useful in heart failure and controlling heart rate in atrial fibrillation. However, digoxin has a narrow therapeutic window, and toxicity can lead to arrhythmias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and visual disturbances. Monitoring serum levels and renal function is important."
    },
    {
        "Q": "What are the hemodynamic changes that occur during the Valsalva maneuver, and how is it used in diagnosing cardiac conditions?",
        "A": "The Valsalva maneuver increases intrathoracic pressure, reducing venous return and preload during the strain phase, followed by a rebound increase in venous return upon release. It is used in diagnosing conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), where the outflow tract obstruction may increase during the maneuver, and in differentiating types of murmurs based on their response to changes in preload and afterload."
    },
    {
        "Q": "How does ischemic preconditioning protect the myocardium, and what are its potential therapeutic applications?",
        "A": "Ischemic preconditioning refers to the phenomenon where brief episodes of ischemia make the myocardium more resistant to subsequent, prolonged ischemia. This protection is mediated by various signaling pathways that reduce cell injury and apoptosis. Therapeutically, preconditioning strategies could reduce myocardial damage during planned ischemic events, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or PCI."
    },
    {
        "Q": "What are the potential causes of high-output heart failure, and how is it managed?",
        "A": "High-output heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to meet the body鈥檚 demands despite an increased cardiac output.

    {
        "Q": "What are the main diagnostic features of pericardial constriction, and how does it differ from restrictive cardiomyopathy?",
        "A": "Pericardial constriction occurs when the pericardium becomes thickened or scarred, restricting diastolic filling of the heart, often leading to symptoms of right-sided heart failure like peripheral edema and ascites. Key diagnostic features include a discordant respiratory variation in ventricular pressures and a \"square root\" sign on ventricular pressure tracings. Restrictive cardiomyopathy affects the myocardium itself, leading to impaired filling due to stiff ventricles rather than external pericardial constriction."
    },
    {
        "Q": "How do diuretics help in managing fluid overload in heart failure, and what are the risks associated with their use?",
        "A": "Diuretics help reduce fluid overload by promoting the excretion of sodium and water, relieving symptoms such as edema and shortness of breath in heart failure. However, their use can lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, and dehydration, which can worsen renal function. Close monitoring of kidney function and electrolytes is essential during diuretic therapy."

    {
        "Q": "What is the role of anticoagulation in patients with mechanical heart valves, and how is the target INR determined?",
        "A": "Anticoagulation with warfarin is essential in patients with mechanical heart valves to prevent thromboembolism. The target international normalized ratio (INR) is determined by the valve type and location, with higher targets (e.g., INR 2.5-3.5) for valves in the mitral position or for more thrombogenic valve designs. Lifelong anticoagulation is required, and close monitoring of INR is necessary to prevent both thromboembolism and bleeding."
    },
    {
        "Q": "How does pregnancy affect cardiovascular physiology, and what are the implications for women with pre-existing heart disease?",
        "A": "Pregnancy increases blood volume, cardiac output, and heart rate, while reducing systemic vascular resistance. These changes can exacerbate pre-existing heart conditions, such as heart failure, valvular disease, or arrhythmias. Women with significant cardiovascular disease should be closely monitored throughout pregnancy, with modifications in therapy as needed to balance maternal and fetal health."
    },
    {
        "Q": "How does cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improve outcomes in patients with heart failure, and what are the criteria for its use?",
        "A": "Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves ventricular coordination in patients with heart failure and left bundle branch block by delivering electrical impulses to both ventricles, enhancing their synchronous contraction. CRT is indicated in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), a wide QRS complex (鈮150 ms), and symptomatic heart failure despite optimal medical therapy. It reduces symptoms, improves quality of life, and lowers mortality."

    {
        "Q": "What is the significance of the coronary flow reserve (CFR) in the assessment of microvascular function, and how is it measured?",
        "A": "Coronary flow reserve (CFR) is the ratio of maximum coronary blood flow during hyperemia to baseline flow, and it reflects the ability of the coronary circulation to meet increased metabolic demands. Impaired CFR indicates microvascular dysfunction, which can occur even in the absence of significant epicardial coronary artery disease. CFR is measured invasively during coronary angiography or non-invasively using imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)."
    },
    {
        "Q": "How does rheumatic heart disease develop, and what are the long-term cardiovascular consequences?",
        "A": "Rheumatic heart disease develops as a result of untreated or inadequately treated group A streptococcal infections, leading to an autoimmune reaction that damages the heart valves, particularly the mitral valve. Over time, this causes valve stenosis or regurgitation, leading to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and an increased risk of infective endocarditis. Long-term management may involve valve repair or replacement, as well as ongoing prevention of recurrent streptococcal infections with antibiotics."
    },
    {

        "Q": "How does left atrial enlargement contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation, and what are the therapeutic implications?",
        "A": "Left atrial enlargement, often due to conditions like hypertension, mitral valve disease, or heart failure, increases the risk of atrial fibrillation by promoting electrical remodeling and fibrosis within the atrial walls. This creates an environment conducive to the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation. Therapeutically, patients with atrial enlargement and atrial fibrillation may require more aggressive rhythm control strategies, such as ablation, and anticoagulation to reduce stroke risk."
    },
    {
        "Q": "What is the role of calcium channel blockers in the management of angina, and how do they differ from beta-blockers in their effects?",
        "A": "Calcium channel blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand by dilating coronary and systemic arteries, reducing afterload, and decreasing heart rate and contractility. They are particularly useful in treating vasospastic angina and are an alternative to beta-blockers in patients who cannot tolerate them. Unlike beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers do not reduce the risk of heart failure in post-myocardial infarction patients but are useful in managing blood pressure and angina symptoms."
    },
    {
        "Q": "What are the mechanisms by which aldosterone antagonists benefit patients with heart failure, and when are they indicated?",
        "A": "Aldosterone antagonists, such as spironolactone and eplerenone, block the effects of aldosterone, a hormone that contributes to sodium retention, potassium excretion, and myocardial fibrosis.

    {
        "Q": "What are the diagnostic criteria for Brugada syndrome, and how does this condition increase the risk of sudden cardiac death?",
        "A": "Brugada syndrome is diagnosed based on characteristic ECG findings, including ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V1-V3), in the absence of structural heart disease. This genetic condition affects sodium channels, leading to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Management includes avoiding fever (which can exacerbate symptoms), sodium channel blockers, and in high-risk individuals, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs)."
    },
    {
        "Q": "How do sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve outcomes in heart failure, particularly in patients without diabetes?",
        "A": "SGLT2 inhibitors, originally developed for diabetes, improve heart failure outcomes by reducing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to osmotic diuresis, natriuresis, and reduced preload and afterload. These effects improve symptoms and reduce hospitalization in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The exact mechanisms are still under study but may involve reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress."
    },
    {
        "Q": "What is the role of catheter ablation in the management of atrial fibrillation, and in which patient populations is it most beneficial?",
        "A": "Catheter ablation targets the sources of abnormal electrical signals in the atria, particularly around the pulmonary veins, to restore normal rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF). It is most beneficial in patients with symptomatic AF who fail to respond to antiarrhythmic medications or prefer a rhythm-control strategy. Ablation is particularly effective in younger patients with paroxysmal AF and without significant structural heart disease."

        "Q": "How does the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis affect left ventricular function, and what are the indications for surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)?",
        "A": "In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve narrows, increasing afterload and leading to left ventricular hypertrophy as the heart compensates. Over time, this can progress to left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. Indications for valve replacement (surgical or TAVR) include severe symptomatic aortic stenosis or asymptomatic severe stenosis with evidence of left ventricular dysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers."
    },
    {
        "Q": "What are the clinical and hemodynamic consequences of pulmonary hypertension, and how is it classified for treatment purposes?",
        "A": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) leads to increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, causing right ventricular overload and eventual right heart failure. It is classified into five groups: pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), PH due to left heart disease, PH due to lung disease or hypoxia, chronic thromboembolic PH, and PH with unclear mechanisms. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, with PAH being treated with vasodilators like prostacyclins, endothelin receptor antagonists, or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors."
    },
    {
        "Q": "How does coronary artery dissection differ from typical atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, and what are the treatment options?",
        "A": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) occurs when a tear forms in the coronary artery wall, leading to separation of the layers and potential obstruction of blood flow. Unlike atherosclerotic disease, SCAD is not caused by plaque buildup and often affects younger individuals, particularly women. Treatment includes conservative management with antiplatelet therapy, or revascularization if there is ongoing ischemia or hemodynamic instability."
